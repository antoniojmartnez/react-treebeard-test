This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

React training application. 
This application builds a multilevel tree that fetchs
the children of each node from a Rest web service.

This is my first application using REACTJs.

This example app uses:
- [React JS] (https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux] (https://es.redux.js.org/)
- Redux promise (https://github.com/redux-utilities/redux-promise)
- React JS beard tree (https://github.com/alexcurtis/react-treebeard)
- Lodash (https://lodash.com/)
- React bootstrap (https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
